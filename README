To use include geocdn.conf in the http stanza of your nginx.conf

http {
...
  include /etc/nginx/geocdn/geocdn.conf
...
}

Now you can conditionally redirect http requests (in server or location stanzas)

set $redirect_to_cdn "$frontend$request_uri";

if ( $redirect_to_cdn ~ "^C/project/vlc" ) {
  rewrite ^ http://$cdn_site.mirror.garr.it/sf$request_uri ;
  break;
}
